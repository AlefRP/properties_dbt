# City Properties Data Warehouse UsingDBT

## Introduction

Welcome to the README for the DBT project aimed at simulating a Data Warehouse or Data Mart for city properties. This project, powered by dbtCore, is structured to facilitate the transformation, analysis, and understanding of property data within a city. It supports critical functions such as urban planning, taxation, and real estate analysis.

## Project Overview

This dbt project is designed to streamline the process of managing and transforming property data, ensuring a scalable and maintainable architecture. It leverages dbtCore for best practices in data modeling, version control, and automated testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- dbtCore installed in your working environment
- Access to the relevant data source(s), such as a SQL database

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or workspace.
2. Ensure dbtCore is installed and configured properly.
3. Update the `dbt_project.yml` file with your database connection details.

## Project Structure

- `models/`: Contains SQL files for dbt models, which define the transformed data structures for analysis.
  - `stg_models/`: Staging models for initial data transformations.
  - `dim_models/`: Dimension models for detailed analytical perspectives.
  - `fact_models/`: Fact models that contain the core business metrics.
- `tests/`: Custom data validation tests to ensure data integrity.
- `macros/`: Reusable pieces of code for dynamic SQL generation in dbt models.
- `data/`: Directory for static data files, if used in the project.
- `dbt_project.yml`: The main project configuration file.

## Usage

After setting up your project, you can run dbt commands to execute models, run tests, and generate documentation:

```bash
dbt run # Runs your dbt models
dbt test # Executes tests defined in the `tests/` directory
dbt docs generate # Generates documentation for your project
dbt docs serve # Serves the generated documentation on a local web server
```
